    <h1>Setup and getting to know elementary OS</h1>


    <p><em>Disclaimer: This guide assumes you have no previous programming experience.
If you have programmed in Java or C# before, chances are this guide is not what you need. You may find chapters or some code examples helpful, though.

<p>This guide is also not done yet and it is probably filled with quirks and bad practises. I just started to learn Vala and programming for <a href="https://elementary.io">elementary OS</a> and am using this right now as a journal to document what I learned and also am documenting it for people who are in the same situation. With more practise I am going to turn this into a more serious beginner guide, but we are far from that.</p>

<p>With that sorted let's start and dive into the world of computer programming, computer science and Appdevelopment.</em></p>
