        <p><strong>This book is in early early alpha stage</strong></p>

        <p>This right now is a loosely organized article series on Vala Programming for people who've never programmed in Vala.
          I myself have also never programmed in Vala. I have programming experience in other languages, though.
          My English is not perfect as well, so bare with me.</p>

          <p>I had trouble finding a really good introduction series for beginners. The elementary guide on writing apps also assumes
            you having some experience with programming and I found the hurdle to get into it still too high.

            So I decided myself to fiddle around a little bit with Vala and elementary
            Apps and thought why not document my progress as well.</p>
            <p>This page is obviously not done yet. I have to do styling and get a domain and need to figure out where this is leading. I'm planning to write this as a small book, though.</p>
